You need the following:
1 x Rpi
1 x MutliWii controller

Attach the MW FC with the RPI through the USB cable given with the MW FC.
Once you have done this go to LXterminal and type dmesg and see to what
USBx the CP210x has connected itself. if you are connected to the 
/dev/ttyUSB0 then just run the code and it will work. if not you will have
to change it to any specific serial port or usb port you want. remember 
this code will also work even if you have connected the MW FC with a serial
port to the RPI.
